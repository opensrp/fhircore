# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2024-05-20

### Added
- Added the in-app PDF Generation feature
  1. Added a new class (PdfGenerator) for generating PDF documents from HTML content using Android's WebView and PrintManager
  2. Introduced a new class (HtmlPopulator) to populate HTML templates with data from a Questionnaire Response
  3. Implemented functionality to launch PDF generation using a configuration setup
- Added Save draft MVP functionality
- Added Delete saved draft feature
- Add configurable confirmation dialog on form submission

## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-15

### Changed
- Upgrade to latest Android FHIR SDK version includes
    1. an upgrade to the HAPI FHIR libraries used to process StructureMaps. In the previous libraries `$this.id` returned `[ResourceType]/[ID #]`, the new libraries return `[ID #]`. Therefore, any existing StructureMaps that call `$this.id` will need to replace that with `$this.type().name + '/' + $this.id` to have the equivalent output.
    2. changes to Measure evaluation that requires all Measure JSON files to be rebuilt.
    3. change to some [MetadataResources](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/metadataresource.html) that requires they are referenced by URL and not ID. Any existing content that referes to StructureMaps by ID must be updated to refer to it by URL. If we are not storing a URL for it, we will need to add that. E.g. `Library.url`, `Plandefinition.url` because the `FhirOperator` API uses that field to uniquely identify/retrieve the Metadata resource.
    4. for CQL evaluation, the context is referred to using `%subject` and not `$this`. The latter is reserved for FHIRPath expressions while the  former is used for CQL expressions to refer to the primary subject of the expression e.g. patient.
