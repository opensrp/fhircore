# Working with rules

Rules are used to define logic and conditions for evaluating and processing healthcare data. FHIR rules can be used to validate data, create alerts and notifications based on certain conditions, or trigger workflows and other automated processes. 
Rules can also be used to extract specific data from a FHIR resource or to transform data from one format to another.

## extractValue() rule

To extract specific data value in the sample JSON below, include **extractValue()** and add the required parameters to the method in order to extract the required value.

``` json
"rules": [
    {
      "name": "familyName",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('familyName', fhirPath.extractValue(Group, 'Group.name'))"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "familyId",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('familyId', fhirPath.extractValue(Group, 'Group.identifier[0].value'))"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "familyLogicalId",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('familyLogicalId', fhirPath.extractValue(Group, 'Group.id'))"
      ]
    }
  ],
```
