# Immunization

OpenSRP 2 is used to support various use cases related to immunization in community and primary healthcare settings. Here we describe our immunization reference app so that health implementors and releated stakeholders can evaluate how it fits into their health care systems.

## Interoperability interfaces

A critical component of immuniation tracking is the ability to connect to and share information with other information systems involved in providing and tracking care. Below we describe some common interoperability interfaces that link immunization workflows to broader health systems information infrastructure.

### Master patient index

A Master patient index (MPI) is an information system that maintains an authoritative list of all patients in specific geographic area, typically a country. We will focus on common use cases that are crticial to successful interoperability.

#### Transmitting a newly registered OpenSRP 2 patient to the MPI

In this use case a patient or client has been newly registered in the mobile app and the mobile app has syncronized its data with the remote FHIR API that servers as the operational data store for the mobile app. We would now like to send this newly stored patient information to a third-party MPI so that any other participaants in the health system also have access to this new patient's information. We will also want to store the ID assigned to the new patient by the MPI in our operation data store's patient API so that we have a 1-to-1 link between our representation of the patient and the MPI's represenatation of the patient.

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Patient

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/patients`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: Patient resource
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- ID assigned by MPI

#### Transmitting changes to an existing OpenSRP 2 patient's demographic details to the MPI

In this use case there is an existing OpenSRP 2 patient that has already been stored in the MPI. OpenSRP 2 has received the patient's ID from the MPI and stored it in its own FHIR Patient resource. Suppose a user of the mobile app edits the patient's details, eventually we would like to propagate these changes to the MPI, ensuring eventually consistency between patient data in the operational FHIR API and the MPI.

![updating a patient in the MPI](/img/iz-domain/patient-updated-mpi.png)

Request
- Path: e.g. `/patients`
- Method: `PUT`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Map of keys and values to change those keys to (potentially nested)
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

### Supply chain

It is not possible to deliver vaccines if the physical commodities (doses in vials, hyperdermic needles, gloves, etc) are not available and there is not an effective supply chain and cold chain to move those commodities from their point of creation, or geographic zone entry, to their point or disbursement or delivery.

Many countries use a logistics management information system (LMIS) to track commodities that are moving through supply chain, incuding vaccines and related vaccine delivery materials. We will describe the common use cases around transmitting stock consumption data from a FHIR API to an LMIS.

#### Transmitting stock consumption to an LMIS

![storing data in the LMIS](/img/iz-domain/stock-to-lmis.png)

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Observation

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/transactions`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: Commodity: ID, Stock change: signed integer, Reason: text
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

### Shared health record

Analogous to the MPI's role as an authoritative list of patients, the shared health record's (SHR) role is to be an authority health record for each patient. Any system that creates or modifies patient health record information is then responsible for transmitting those additions or changes to the shared health record system. Any system that is requires access to the shared health record will have to authenticate itself, prove that it is authorized, and can then retrieve the shared health record. Shared health records are typicall structured to follow a well defined standard within FHIR, such as the [internation patient summary (IPS)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/). This way shared health records are portable between any systems that understands the IPS standard.

#### Storing an immunization in the shared health record

We assume the patient already has a shared health record identified by their MPI ID number. The MPI can manage this by creating an empty shared health record whenever it creates a new patient. The FHIR data store has received new FHIR Observation resources that represent a vaccine being delivered. It then sends the new Observations to the shared health record API along with the patient's MPI. The shared health record services interprets and extracts information from the Observations to update the stored record for the patient.

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Observation

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/update`
- Method: `POST`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Observations to store
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

#### Storing conditions from a screening in the shared health record

This use case is similar to above except that instead a vaccine being delivered and new FHIR Observation resources being created, we assume an assessment or screening has been complianted and a new condition is discovered in the patient, represented by a new FHIR Condition resource. The FHIR data store receives new FHIR Condition resources and sends it to the shared health record API along with the patient's MPI ID. The shared health record services then interprets and extracts information from the Condition to update the stored record for the patient.

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Condition

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/update`
- Method: `POST`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Conditions to store
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure
