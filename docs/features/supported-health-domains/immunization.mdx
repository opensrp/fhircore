# Immunization

## Interoperability interfaces

A critical component of immuniation tracking is the ability to connect to and share information with other information systems involved in providing and tracking care. Below we describe some common interoperability interfaces that link immunization workflows to broader health systems information infrastructure.

### Master patient index

A Master patient index (MPI) is an information system that maintains an authoritative list of all patients in specific geographic area, typically a country. We will focus on common use cases that are crticial to successful interoperability.

#### Transmitting a newly registered OpenSRP 2 patient to the MPI

In this use case a patient or client has been newly registered in the mobile app and the mobile app has syncronized its data with the remote FHIR API that servers as the operational data store for the mobile app. We would now like to send this newly stored patient information to a third-party MPI so that any other participaants in the health system also have access to this new patient's information. We will also want to store the ID assigned to the new patient by the MPI in our operation data store's patient API so that we have a 1-to-1 link between our representation of the patient and the MPI's represenatation of the patient.

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Patient

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/patients`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: Patient resource
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- ID assigned by MPI

#### Transmitting changes to an existing OpenSRP 2 patient's demographic details to the MPI

![updating a patient in the MPI](/img/iz-domain/patient-updated-mpi.png)

Request
- Path: e.g. `/patients`
- Method: `PUT`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Map of keys and values to change those keys to (potentially nested)
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

### Supply chain

It is not possible to deliver vaccines if the physical commodities (doses in vials, hyperdermic needles, gloves, etc) are not available and there is not an effective supply chain and cold chain to move those commodities from their point of creation, or geographic zone entry, to their point or disbursement or delivery.

Many countries use a logistics management information system (LMIS) to track commodities that are moving through supply chain, incuding vaccines and related vaccine delivery materials. We will describe the common use cases around transmitting stock consumption data from a FHIR API to an LMIS.

#### Transmitting stock consumption to an LMIS

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Observation

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/transactions`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: Commodity: ID, Stock change: signed integer, Reason: text
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

### Shared health record

Analogous to the MPI's role as an authoritative list of patients, the shared health record's (SHR) role is to be an authority health record for each patient. Any system that creates or modifies patient health record information is then responsible for transmitting those additions or changes to the shared health record system. Any system that is requires access to the shared health record will have to authenticate itself, prove that it is authorized, and can then retrieve the shared health record.

#### Storing conditions from a screening in the shared health record
