### Core workflow

The core immunization workflow in a health app, such as an Electronic Immunization Registry (EIR), is designed to ensure that children and other eligible populations receive timely vaccinations, that records are properly maintained, and that healthcare workers can easily track immunization coverage and follow up on missed vaccinations. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how this workflow typically operates:

1. Patient Registration

The first step in the immunization workflow involves registering the patient into the system. This can occur either at a health facility or during an outreach visit.

	* New Patient Entry: If the patient (child or adult) is not already in the system, the CHW or health worker creates a new patient profile by collecting:

	* Full name, date of birth, and gender.

	* Unique identifier (generated by the system or linked to a national ID).

	* Address and contact information.

	* Caregiver information (for children).

	* Existing Patient Search: If the patient has already been registered, the health worker can use the search function to pull up their existing profile using their unique ID, name, or other identifiers.

2. Verification of Immunization Status

Once the patient is registered or located, the health worker will check their immunization history in the app to determine what vaccines have been administered and which ones are due or overdue.

	* Vaccination History: The app will display a list of all past vaccinations, including dates and doses.

	* Scheduled Vaccinations: Based on the patient’s age and previous vaccinations, the system will generate a schedule of due and upcoming vaccines.

	* Missed Vaccinations: The system flags any missed doses and recommends a catch-up schedule based on national immunization guidelines.

3. Vaccine Administration

When the patient is due for a vaccine, the healthcare worker administers the vaccine and records the details in the app.

	* Vaccine Selection: The health worker selects the appropriate vaccine from a drop-down list based on what is due (e.g., BCG, DPT, OPV, MMR).

	* Dose and Batch Information: The app prompts the worker to enter the dose number (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd), the batch number, and the expiry date of the vaccine being administered.

	* Administration Method: The method of administration (e.g., oral, intramuscular) and site (e.g., arm, thigh) can also be logged.

4. Recording the Vaccination

Once the vaccine is administered, the health worker updates the patient’s immunization record in the app.

	* Date of Vaccination: The date is automatically logged or manually entered.

	* Vaccine Details: The app records the specific vaccine, dose, batch number, and location where it was administered.

	* Healthcare Provider Information: The name of the health worker administering the vaccine is usually automatically logged for accountability and traceability.

5. Generating Next Vaccination Schedule

After recording the current vaccination, the system automatically updates the patient’s profile with the next scheduled vaccination based on their age and national immunization guidelines.

	* Auto-Scheduling: The system calculates the next due date for vaccinations, ensuring that healthcare workers can keep track of upcoming vaccinations.

	* Catch-up Schedule: If the patient has missed vaccines, the system creates a catch-up schedule that ensures all missed doses are given at appropriate intervals.

6. Providing Immunization Card (Optional)

In some settings, the health worker provides an updated immunization card or booklet for the caregiver to keep. This card serves as a physical record for the patient’s caregiver and is often used in tandem with digital records.

	* Printed Records: Some systems allow the printing of vaccination records directly from the app.

7. Sending Reminders and Notifications

The system sends automated reminders and notifications to caregivers and healthcare providers about upcoming vaccinations or missed doses.

	* SMS Reminders: The app can send an SMS reminder to the caregiver before the next vaccination is due using RapidPro

	* CHW Alerts: The CHW or health facility receives alerts if patients are overdue for a vaccination, enabling them to follow up directly.

8. Reporting and Analytics

The app collects and aggregates immunization data to provide real-time reports that can be used for monitoring vaccination coverage, identifying gaps, and planning outreach programs.

	* Coverage Reports: The system generates vaccination coverage reports for different age groups, geographic areas, and specific vaccines (e.g., how many children received all their doses of the DPT vaccine).

	* Missed Opportunities: Identifies areas with high rates of missed vaccinations and suggests targeted outreach activities.

	* Data Export: Reports can be exported to central health systems or ministries for national-level tracking and decision-making.


9. Integration with Other Health Services

The system can also be integrated with other health interventions to streamline healthcare delivery. For example:

	* Growth Monitoring: Some systems include growth monitoring features (e.g., tracking height, weight, and MUAC) during vaccination visits.

	* Referrals: If a patient has a health issue identified during a vaccination visit, the app can generate a referral to another healthcare provider for further care.

10. Data Privacy and Security

Throughout the workflow, the system ensures that all patient data is securely stored and accessible only to authorized health personnel.

	* Encryption and Authentication: Data is encrypted, and health workers need proper credentials to access or modify records.

	* Informed Consent: Before entering patient data, the caregiver’s consent is usually obtained.

11. Offline Functionality and Syncing

In areas with limited connectivity, the app often allows for offline data entry. healthcare workers can record immunizations during outreach, and the system syncs the data when connectivity is restored.

	* Offline Mode: healthcare workers can still register new patients, update immunization records, and schedule follow-ups without internet access.

	* Automatic Syncing: When back online, the app automatically uploads all stored data to the central server.

## Registering households

Household registration in a health app, such as an Electronic Immunization Registry (EIR) or community health platform, captures key information about the household as a unit, linking family members to provide a holistic view of health and wellness. This registration process helps healthcare workers track and manage healthcare interventions at the household level. Household registration plays a crucial role in improving access to healthcare, identifying at-risk families, and facilitating effective delivery of health services, particularly in community-based settings.

Incorporating growth monitoring and Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) assessments into the EIR app for healthcare workers would expand its functionality to support broader child health and nutrition monitoring. By adding growth monitoring and MUAC tracking, the EIR app could help healthcare workers detect malnutrition and growth delays early, support targeted interventions, and improve child health outcomes. Here’s how these functions could be integrated:

1. Growth Monitoring

	* Anthropometric Data Recording:

		* Allows healthcare workers to input key growth indicators such as height, weight, and head circumference for children at regular intervals.

2. MUAC (Mid-Upper Arm Circumference) Monitoring

	* MUAC Measurement Recording:

		* Allows healthcare workers to log MUAC measurements as a quick and effective way to assess acute malnutrition in children.

3. Integrated Reporting and Alerts

	* Comprehensive Health Reports:

		* Summary Indicators of all interventions that are being recorded and tracked on the app

4. Data Sharing and Coordination

	* Peer to Peer ssync between

		* Supervisors

		* healthcare workers in the same location hierachy levels

5. Offline Functionality

	* Offline Data Entry:

		* Enables healthcare workers to data even in areas without internet connectivity, with synchronization occurring when the device is back online.

6. Covid 19 for Adult Vaccination

	* Register patients and log COVID-19 status.

	* Schedule and record COVID-19 tests.

	* Record and track vaccinations (including reminders for doses).

## Interoperability interfaces

A critical component of immuniation tracking is the ability to connect to and share information with other information systems involved in providing and tracking care. Below we describe some common interoperability interfaces that link immunization workflows to broader health systems information infrastructure.

### Master patient index

A Master patient index (MPI) is an information system that maintains an authoritative list of all patients in specific geographic area, typically a country. We will focus on common use cases that are crticial to successful interoperability.

#### Transmitting a newly registered OpenSRP 2 patient to the MPI

In this use case a patient or client has been newly registered in the mobile app and the mobile app has syncronized its data with the remote FHIR API that servers as the operational data store for the mobile app. We would now like to send this newly stored patient information to a third-party MPI so that any other participaants in the health system also have access to this new patient's information. We will also want to store the ID assigned to the new patient by the MPI in our operation data store's patient API so that we have a 1-to-1 link between our representation of the patient and the MPI's represenatation of the patient.

![storing a new patient in the MPI](/img/iz-domain/patient-to-mpi.png)

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Patient

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/patients`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: Patient resource
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- ID assigned by MPI

#### Transmitting changes to an existing OpenSRP 2 patient's demographic details to the MPI

In this use case there is an existing OpenSRP 2 patient that has already been stored in the MPI. OpenSRP 2 has received the patient's ID from the MPI and stored it in its own FHIR Patient resource. Suppose a user of the mobile app edits the patient's details, eventually we would like to propagate these changes to the MPI, ensuring eventually consistency between patient data in the operational FHIR API and the MPI.

![updating a patient in the MPI](/img/iz-domain/patient-updated-mpi.png)

Request
- Path: e.g. `/patients`
- Method: `PUT`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Map of keys and values to change those keys to (potentially nested)
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

### Supply chain

It is not possible to deliver vaccines if the physical commodities (doses in vials, hyperdermic needles, gloves, etc) are not available and there is not an effective supply chain and cold chain to move those commodities from their point of creation, or geographic zone entry, to their point or disbursement or delivery.

Many countries use a logistics management information system (LMIS) to track commodities that are moving through supply chain, incuding vaccines and related vaccine delivery materials. We will describe the common use cases around transmitting stock consumption data from a FHIR API to an LMIS.

#### Transmitting stock consumption to an LMIS

![storing data in the LMIS](/img/iz-domain/stock-to-lmis.png)

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Observation

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/transactions`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: Commodity: ID, Stock change: signed integer, Reason: text
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

### Shared health record

Analogous to the MPI's role as an authoritative list of patients, the shared health record's (SHR) role is to be an authority health record for each patient. Any system that creates or modifies patient health record information is then responsible for transmitting those additions or changes to the shared health record system. Any system that is requires access to the shared health record will have to authenticate itself, prove that it is authorized, and can then retrieve the shared health record. Shared health records are typicall structured to follow a well defined standard within FHIR, such as the [internation patient summary (IPS)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/). This way shared health records are portable between any systems that understands the IPS standard.

#### Storing an immunization in the shared health record

We assume the patient already has a shared health record identified by their MPI ID number. The MPI can manage this by creating an empty shared health record whenever it creates a new patient. The FHIR data store has received new FHIR Observation resources that represent a vaccine being delivered. It then sends the new Observations to the shared health record API along with the patient's MPI. The shared health record services interprets and extracts information from the Observations to update the stored record for the patient.

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Observation

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/update`
- Method: `POST`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Observations to store
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure

#### Storing conditions from a screening in the shared health record

This use case is similar to above except that instead a vaccine being delivered and new FHIR Observation resources being created, we assume an assessment or screening has been complianted and a new condition is discovered in the patient, represented by a new FHIR Condition resource. The FHIR data store receives new FHIR Condition resources and sends it to the shared health record API along with the patient's MPI ID. The shared health record services then interprets and extracts information from the Condition to update the stored record for the patient.

FHIR Resources to transmit:
- Condition

Request:
- Path: e.g. `/update`
- Method: `POST`
- Parameters
    - ID: `[Patient.identifier[first where type=MPI].value]`
- Body: Conditions to store
- Headers: Authentication token

Response:
- Success or failure
