# Admin Dashboard Features

This guide outlines the steps to follow to manage Users, Care Team, Organization and Locations on OpenSRP. The platform is named FHIR Web and interacts with the Keycloak and HAPI FHIR servers.

### Prerequisites
To navigate through this user guide, you are required to have admin access to the admin portal. In addition, you will need to understand how the different entities tie to each other. Below is a summary.

A user represents anyone who will interact with the FHIR SDK-based App or FHIR Web. A user is assigned permission through roles defined in Keycloak which maintains all user authentication. Keycloak defines permissions in the form of roles that can be assigned to a user based on the activities they are expected to carry out. Due to the long list of roles, FHIR Web presents the option to create user groups, which represent a collection of roles that can be assigned to a user.

A user who is expected to interact with the health workflows, is assigned to a care team. A care team is then assigned to an organization (also known as a team). The organization is then assigned to a location which is the lowest point in the hierarchy that a user is expected to interact in while fulfilling the health workflows.
