The configurations in Single APK Approach is using the combination of a single Composition and many Binary resource.

## Composition
Composition represents a single appId and is the entry point to access all the Binary configs associated with that appId.

Example of appId: anc, ecbis, quest, etc.

### Defining your own Composition
To define a Composition config, there are 2 attributes to be highlighted. It is the `identifier` and `section` attributes.

These attributes are the common differences that developers need to specifically fill, the other attributes can be generic by using our own template and some are also automatically generated by the FHIR server.

* `identifier`

   The `identifier` is a unique value that represents an appId and will differentiate a Composition config from one another.
   ```json
   {
     "identifier": {
       "use": "official",
       "value": "appId"
     }
   }
   ```

* `section`

   TODO
