# Technical Overview

OpenSRP is a platform for delivering digital health services. It has been used in projects ranging from single location research studies to national health systems caring for over a hundred million patients.

The Android app is primarily written in Kotlinâ€‹, architected as a FHIR-native platform, and powered by [Android FHIR SDK](https://github.com/google/android-fhir). Find OpenSRP on Github: [OpenSRP Android App](https://github.com/opensrp/fhircore), [OpenSRP Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/opensrp/web)

The OpenSRP platform consists of three components: (1) [OpenSRP Android App](/android-app), (2) [OpenSRP Admin Dashboard](/about-opensrp/admin-dashboard-features), and (3) OpenSRP Analytics Dashboard. In addition, OpenSRP relies on a number of other modular tools as described in the diagram below.
