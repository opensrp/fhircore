# Register configuration

Registers are the entry point to FHIRCore application. Typically this is a list used to displayed the configured [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/resourcelist.html). Clicking on a register item directs the user to the configured profile.

:::info
For every register in the application there should at least be one profile configuration. Similar registers can re-use the same profile configuration.
