# Refresh/Invalidate cache

Event management implementation provides the ability to configure when to invalidate register cache after form submission.

Since we currently cache the register data, we need to refresh/invalidate the cache every time a patient or family is removed from the app. This is to make sure the UI shows the correct data at all times.

The `refreshContent` field in the `questionnaireConfig` determines whether the register cache should be invalidated when a form is submitted.

## Sample questionnaire with `refreshContent`

``` json
       {
         "title": "Pregnancy Outcome",
         "titleColor": "@{patientTextColor}",
         "visible": "@{isPregnant}",
         "enabled": "@{patientActive}",
         "actions": [
           {
             "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
             "workflow": "LAUNCH_QUESTIONNAIRE",
             "questionnaire": {
               "id": "questionnaire-uuid",
               "title": "Pregnancy outcome",
               "resourceIdentifier": "@{patientId}",
               "planDefinitions": [
                 "planDefinitions-uuid"
               ],
               "refreshContent" : true
             }
           }
         ]
       }
```
