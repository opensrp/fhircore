# Profile configuration

These configurations are used to control the content of the profile screen as well as how to render the profile UI. Typically for every register in application there is a corresponding profile. Technically the same implemention is used for all profiles, however the content configured.

:::info
For every register in the application there should at least be one profile configuration. Similar registers can re-use the same profile configuration.

## Dynamic data pass between Profiles and registers

For you to pass data between profiles  you can make use of **action config params** which are executed when **LAUNCH_PROFILE** is invoked
Data extraction happens during rules execution and is persisted in computedValuesMap which is later used to interpolated values annotated with @value
For example, assume the LAUNCH_PROFILE onClick function of practitioner_profile_config takes you to household_profile screen and you would like pass send practitionerId from practitioner_profile_config to household_profile, define it as described below

### Practitioner LAUNCH_PROFILE
#### Sample JSON
1. Write rules to extract the data you need.
``` json
"rules":[
     {
      "name": "practitionerId",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('practitionerId', fhirPath.extractValue(Practitioner, 'Practitioner.id.replace(\"Practitioner/\",\"\")').split(\"/\").get(0))"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

2. add your params at **LAUNCH_REGISTER** section of practition_register_config.json
#### Sample JSON
``` json
            "actions": [
              {
                "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
                "workflow": "LAUNCH_PROFILE",
                "id": "practitionerProfile",
                "params": [
                  {
                    "paramType": "PARAMDATA",
                    "key": "practitionerId",
                    "value": "@{practitionerId}"
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
```

### Household_config.json
A dataquery config to filter by practitionerId. For more info refer to dataquery section

#### Sample JSON

``` json
      {
          "id": "householdQueryPractitionerId",
          "filterType": "TOKEN",
          "key": "_tag",
          "valueType": "CODING",
          "valueCoding": {
            "system": "https://smartregister.org/",
            "code": "@{practitionerId}"
          }
        }
```
