# Profile configuration

These configurations are used to control the content of the profile screen as well as how to render the profile UI. Typically for every register in application there is a corresponding profile. Technically the same implemention is used for all profiles, however the content configured.

:::info
For every register in the application there should at least be one profile configuration. Similar registers can re-use the same profile configuration.
