# Widget configurations

Configurations used to configure widgets. FHIR Core uses widgets to render views. Examples are rows, columns, cards, and buttons.

## Flex alignment widgets

To display items in flexRow below sample JSON config works fine. Replace **COMPOUND_TEXT** with your preferred widget component. Please note, the below json borrows from **LIST** component properties

``` json
{
     "viewType": "LIST",
      "id": "give_your_list_an_id",
      "baseResource": "Resource_to_use",
      "orientation": "HORIZONTAL",
       "emptyList": {
        "message": ""
                     },
        "registerCard": {
        "rules": [],
         "views": [
          {
           "viewType": "COMPOUND_TEXT",
            "primaryTextBackgroundColor": "#F9CFD1",
             "primaryText": "@{carePlanTitle}",
             "primaryTextColor": "@{carePlanTextColor}",
             "fontSize": 13,
             "padding": 7,
              "borderRadius": 6
      }
    ]
    }
   }
 ```

## Display resources inside another list
To display list resources inside a list and execute it's rules , add it an attribute called **resources** inside your list and define it's parameters as shown in the list below
If the config doesn't have a **resources** attribute, the app logic defaults to using relatedResources and executes rules in the rule config section.
``` json
{
  "viewType": "LIST",
  "id": "readyTasksList",
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "availableTask",
      "relatedResourceId": "availableTasks",
      "resourceType": "Task",
      "conditionalFhirPathExpression": "((Task.status = 'ready' or Task.status = 'cancelled' or  Task.status = 'failed') and (Task.code.empty()))"
    }
  ],
  "emptyList": {
    "message": "No visit tasks available for this patient at the moment"
  },
  "registerCard": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "taskStatus",
        "condition": "true",
        "actions": [
          "data.put('taskStatus', fhirPath.extractValue(Task, 'Task.status'))"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "views": [
      {
        "viewType": "BUTTON",
        "smallSized": "true",
        "text": "@{taskDescriptionWithStartDate}",
        "status": "@{taskStatusColorCode}",
        "visible": "true",
        "enabled": "@{patientActive}",
        "actions": [
          {
            "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
            "workflow": "LAUNCH_QUESTIONNAIRE",
            "questionnaire": {
              "id": "@{taskQuestionnaireId}",
              "title": "@{taskDescription}",
              "saveButtonText": "Save",
              "taskId": "@{taskId}",
              "resourceIdentifier": "@{taskFor}"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
 ```

## COLUMN widgets
The column widgets are used to create a vertical layout container that can hold multiple child views. The purpose of the "COLUMN" is to arrange child views in a vertical column, with the child views stacked on top of one another in the order in which they are added.

 ``` json
 {
                  "viewType": "COLUMN",
