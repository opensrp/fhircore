# Admin Dashboard

We use [fhir-web](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-web) as the admin dashboard for OpenSRP 2 projects. This allows you to manage users, teams and view data. See more details on the [admin dashboard features](/features/admin-dashboard-features).

## Users and the FHIR Practitioner resource

OpenSRP2 manages user accounts through an integrated identity and authentication management (IAM) system. Each `user` created in the IAM system has a 1-to-1 link with FHIR `Practitioner` resource in the FHIR health data store.

## User Assignments

The current user assignment consists of 4 main elements
- **User (FHIR Practitioner)** - This is the person using the application to collect data and execute workflows
- **CareTeam** - Caregiving users would be assigned here.
- **Team (FHIR Organization)** - Teams would be added to CareTeams as managing organizations.
- **Location** - Teams would be assigned to locations and by doing so, users would be assigned to their workstations.

Every user who is _“correctly”_ assigned as per the current implementation must have at least 1 of each of the 4 elements. These assignment information has an associated effect to how data is [synced down](/engineering/backend/info-gateway/data-sync) to the mobile applications.

These elements are then downloaded to the OpenSRP 2.0 mobile application via the **PractitionerDetail** endpoint.  This is a custom endpoint built by the OpenSRP team, it aggregates all the data related to a user and returns as one response.
