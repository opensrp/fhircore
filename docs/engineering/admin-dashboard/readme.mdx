# Admin Dashboard

We use [fhir-web](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-web) as the admin dashboard for OpenSRP 2 projects. This allows you to manage users, teams and view data. See more details on the [admin dashboard features](/features/admin-dashboard-features).

## Users and the FHIR Practitioner resource

OpenSRP2 manages user accounts through an integrated identity and authentication management (IAM) system. Each `user` created in the IAM system has a 1-to-1 link with FHIR `Practitioner` resource in the FHIR health data store.

## User Assignment

User assignment consists of 4 main elements
- **User (FHIR Practitioner)** - This is the person using the application to collect data and execute workflows
- **CareTeam** - This is used to define a group of users that provide care as a team.
- **Team (FHIR Organization)** - Teams are added to CareTeams as the `.managingOrganization`.
- **Location** - Teams are assigned to Locations to define where they work.

Every user must have at least 1 of the 4 elements above. These assignments affect how data is [synced down](/engineering/backend/info-gateway/data-sync) to the app.

These elements are then downloaded to the app via the **PractitionerDetail** endpoint. This is a custom endpoint that aggregates data related to a user and returns as a single response.
