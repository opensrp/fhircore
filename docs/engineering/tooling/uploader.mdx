# uploader script
A bash script to help with uploading content

## How to use it
- Make sure the script is executable. Use `ls -l` to check for permissions and `chmod +x <file-name>` to make it executable.

- Update the `config.txt` file with your credentials, resource folder name and base FHIR server url. See the [sample-config file](sample_config.txt) for examples

- On the command line run `bash uploader.sh`
- Output will be posted to a file named `output.txt` in the same folder
