# fhircore-tooling

fhir-tooling simplifies FHIR data management by converting, validating, extracting, uploading, and cleaning resources.

- [**cleaner**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/blob/a2f435fce32f029260f8ecda81f41703b4b05456/cleaner/README.md) - it efficiently removes specific FHIR resources from a FHIR API based on user-defined filtering criteria, streamlining data maintenance.
- [**efsity**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/blob/2c94aeeb54a39964cc5ba158ec077e2d1f73564e/efsity/README.md) - efsity streamlines authoring and managing FHIRCore app configurations and content through command-line conversions, validations, translations, and publishing.
- [**importer**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/blob/a2f435fce32f029260f8ecda81f41703b4b05456/importer/README.md) - The importer script streamlines the management of FHIR resources and Keycloak roles through CSV-based bulk operations, covering creation, assignment, updates, and even deletion of duplicates.
- [**uploader**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/blob/a2f435fce32f029260f8ecda81f41703b4b05456/importer/README.md) - The uploader script automates content uploads to a FHIR server, simplifying the process through command-line execution and configuration.
