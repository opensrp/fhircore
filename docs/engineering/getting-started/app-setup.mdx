# App Setup

This guide assumes you have an existing FHIR Store set up with a typical FHIR Information Gateway connected to a backend Identity and Access Management (IAM) system and transactional FHIR data store with a standard FHIR API.

We will go through the example of setting up an electronic immunization registry (EIR) for a community health worker (CHW) expected to use the app. As we go we will note reusable pieces of functionality and at the end we will reference a number of use cases that can be addressed with a similar pattern.
