#### Preview of work so far

The core immunization workflow in a health app, such as an Electronic Immunization Registry (EIR), is designed to ensure that children and other eligible populations receive timely vaccinations, that records are properly maintained, and that healthcare workers (CHWs) can easily track immunization coverage and follow up on missed vaccinations. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how this workflow typically operates:

1. Patient Registration

The first step in the immunization workflow involves registering the patient into the system. This can occur either at a health facility or during an outreach visit.

	•	New Patient Entry: If the patient (child or adult) is not already in the system, the CHW or health worker creates a new patient profile by collecting:
	•	Full name, date of birth, and gender.
	•	Unique identifier (generated by the system or linked to a national ID).
	•	Address and contact information.
	•	Caregiver information (for children).
	•	Existing Patient Search: If the patient has already been registered, the health worker can use the search function to pull up their existing profile using their unique ID, name, or other identifiers.

2. Verification of Immunization Status

Once the patient is registered or located, the health worker will check their immunization history in the app to determine what vaccines have been administered and which ones are due or overdue.

	•	Vaccination History: The app will display a list of all past vaccinations, including dates and doses.
	•	Scheduled Vaccinations: Based on the patient’s age and previous vaccinations, the system will generate a schedule of due and upcoming vaccines.
	•	Missed Vaccinations: The system flags any missed doses and recommends a catch-up schedule based on national immunization guidelines.

3. Vaccine Administration

When the patient is due for a vaccine, the healthcare worker administers the vaccine and records the details in the app.

	•	Vaccine Selection: The health worker selects the appropriate vaccine from a drop-down list based on what is due (e.g., BCG, DPT, OPV, MMR).
	•	Dose and Batch Information: The app prompts the worker to enter the dose number (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd), the batch number, and the expiry date of the vaccine being administered.
	•	Administration Method: The method of administration (e.g., oral, intramuscular) and site (e.g., arm, thigh) can also be logged.

4. Recording the Vaccination

Once the vaccine is administered, the health worker updates the patient’s immunization record in the app.

	•	Date of Vaccination: The date is automatically logged or manually entered.
	•	Vaccine Details: The app records the specific vaccine, dose, batch number, and location where it was administered.
	•	Healthcare Provider Information: The name of the health worker administering the vaccine is usually automatically logged for accountability and traceability.

5. Generating Next Vaccination Schedule

After recording the current vaccination, the system automatically updates the patient’s profile with the next scheduled vaccination based on their age and national immunization guidelines.

	•	Auto-Scheduling: The system calculates the next due date for vaccinations, ensuring that CHWs can keep track of upcoming vaccinations.
	•	Catch-up Schedule: If the patient has missed vaccines, the system creates a catch-up schedule that ensures all missed doses are given at appropriate intervals.

6. Providing Immunization Card (Optional)

In some settings, the health worker provides an updated immunization card or booklet for the caregiver to keep. This card serves as a physical record for the patient’s caregiver and is often used in tandem with digital records.

	•	Printed Records: Some systems allow the printing of vaccination records directly from the app.

7. Sending Reminders and Notifications

The system sends automated reminders and notifications to caregivers and healthcare providers about upcoming vaccinations or missed doses.

	•	SMS Reminders: The app can send an SMS reminder to the caregiver before the next vaccination is due using RapidPro
	•	CHW Alerts: The CHW or health facility receives alerts if patients are overdue for a vaccination, enabling them to follow up directly.

8. Reporting and Analytics

The app collects and aggregates immunization data to provide real-time reports that can be used for monitoring vaccination coverage, identifying gaps, and planning outreach programs.

	•	Coverage Reports: The system generates vaccination coverage reports for different age groups, geographic areas, and specific vaccines (e.g., how many children received all their doses of the DPT vaccine).
	•	Missed Opportunities: Identifies areas with high rates of missed vaccinations and suggests targeted outreach activities.
	•	Data Export: Reports can be exported to central health systems or ministries for national-level tracking and decision-making.

9. Integration with Other Health Services

The system can also be integrated with other health interventions to streamline healthcare delivery. For example:

	•	Growth Monitoring: Some systems include growth monitoring features (e.g., tracking height, weight, and MUAC) during vaccination visits.
	•	Referrals: If a patient has a health issue identified during a vaccination visit, the app can generate a referral to another healthcare provider for further care.

10. Data Privacy and Security

Throughout the workflow, the system ensures that all patient data is securely stored and accessible only to authorized health personnel.

	•	Encryption and Authentication: Data is encrypted, and health workers need proper credentials to access or modify records.
	•	Informed Consent: Before entering patient data, the caregiver’s consent is usually obtained.

11. Offline Functionality and Syncing

In areas with limited connectivity, the app often allows for offline data entry. CHWs can record immunizations during outreach, and the system syncs the data when connectivity is restored.

	•	Offline Mode: CHWs can still register new patients, update immunization records, and schedule follow-ups without internet access.
	•	Automatic Syncing: When back online, the app automatically uploads all stored data to the central server.

Immunization Workflow Summary:

	1.	Register the patient or locate their profile in the system.
	2.	Verify immunization status (check history, see what’s due).
	3.	Administer the vaccine and record the details.
	4.	Update the patient’s profile with the new vaccination information.
	5.	Schedule the next vaccination (or create a catch-up plan).
	6.	Provide reminders to caregivers and health workers.
	7.	Follow-up on missed vaccinations and track defaulters.
	8.	Generate reports and analytics for monitoring and decision-making.

This core immunization workflow ensures that patients are vaccinated on time, their records are accurately maintained, and healthcare providers can efficiently monitor coverage and follow up on any missed doses.
