# Server Setup

This guides you through the process of setting up the backend server infrastructure needed to use the OpenSRP 2 app. We then discuss how to deploy optional extensions for administration, data warehousing, integrations, etc.

# Monitoring
Once the servers have been deployed it will be necessary to monitor the deployed applications. Sentry has been integrated on FHIR android app, web and server to aid application monitoring and logging.
Apart from application monitoring one has to monitor the server resources and proxy logs. Graylog, fluent-bit(log forwarder) and prometheus are some of the tools one can use.
Alerting can be configured  on these tools to help notify when a supposed threshold is reached.

# Backup
Ensure that a backup system exists on the infrastructure, especially for the database. 

# PostDeployment Checklist (TPMs and Engineers)
* Uploading FHIR resources.
* Uploading the FHIR composition payload.
* Create Keycloak Realm and client.
* Create/Upload the keycloak roles and groups.
* Create Users.
