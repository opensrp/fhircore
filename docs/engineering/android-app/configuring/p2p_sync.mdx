# P2P Sync

OpenSRP supports device-to-device syncing through an additional library. To add the P2P library use ```p2p-lib = "XXX-SNAPSHOT``` in your `libs.version.toml` file. After this sync your application to update the added library.

## Enabling P2P sync configuration

To enble P2P sync we need to make changes to enable viweing P2P UI elements and configure what to sync over P2P.

### Navigation configurations

```json
{
    "id": "p2p_sync",
    "visible": true,
    "display": "Transfer Data",
    "menuIconConfig": {
        "type": "local",
        "reference": "ic_p2p"
    },
    "actions": [
        {
            "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
            "workflow": "DEVICE_TO_DEVICE_SYNC",
            "id": "navigateToP2PScreen"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Config properties of P2P sync

|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|:--:|
id | uniquieId of your p2p_sync block | yes |  |
visible | Boolean to show whether this is to be shown | yes | `apps` |
display | Title text that should be shown on the device | yes | |
menuIconConfig | The icon to show. This can be configured through ICON configuration. See widgets | No  |  |
actions |  Action to be performed when once clicks on the display above. See actions parameters under questionnaire | yes | |

:::info
A WORKFLOW can be launched anywhere on the app through an action. Either by a text link, actionable button, or image icon.

#### Resources to sync

You also need to define which resources to be synced. This configuration should be added as part of Application configuration file under config-types/application

``` json
"deviceToDeviceSync": {
    "resourcesToSync": [
        "Group",
        "Patient",
        "CarePlan",
        "Task",
        "Encounter",
        "Observation",
        "Condition",
        "Questionnaire",
        "QuestionnaireResponse",
        "RelatedPerson",
        "Flag",
        "Immunization"
    ]
}
```
This can be simplified by a sample workflow show on the image below.
