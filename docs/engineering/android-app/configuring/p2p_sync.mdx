# Device P2P Sync configuration
FhirCore android supports Device to device data sharing via Point-to-Point syncing.
 Add P2P library as one of your dependencies. For the example in FhirCore, we use ```p2p-lib = "XXX-SNAPSHOT``` in the libs.version.toml file. Once done, sync your application to update the added library

### Enabling p2p sync configuration
This is done through two ways.
a. Navigation configurations

```json
     {
         "id": "p2p_sync",
         "visible": true,
         "display": "Transfer Data",
         "menuIconConfig": {
           "type": "local",
           "reference": "ic_p2p"
         },
         "actions": [
           {
             "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
             "workflow": "DEVICE_TO_DEVICE_SYNC",
             "id": "navigateToP2PScreen"
           }
         ]
       }
```
### Config properties of P2P Sync configs
|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|:--:|
id | uniquieId of your p2p_sync block | yes |  |
visible | Boolean to show whether this is to be shown | yes | `apps` |
display |  title text that should be shown on the device | yes | |
menuIconConfig | The icon to be shown. This can be configured through ICON configuration. See widgets | No  |  |
actions |  Action to be performed when once clicks on the display above. See actions parameters under questionnaire | yes | |

NB: Remember, a WORKFLOW can be launched anywhere on the app through an action. Either by a text, actionable button or image icon hence the above config can be used anywhere else.


b. ### Resources to sync
You also need to define which resources to be synced. This configuration should be added as part of Application configuration file under config-types/application

``` json
      "deviceToDeviceSync": {
        "resourcesToSync": [
          "Group",
          "Patient",
          "CarePlan",
          "Task",
          "Encounter",
          "Observation",
          "Condition",
          "Questionnaire",
          "QuestionnaireResponse",
          "RelatedPerson",
          "Flag",
          "Immunization"
        ]
      }
```
This can be simplified by a sample workflow show on the image below.
