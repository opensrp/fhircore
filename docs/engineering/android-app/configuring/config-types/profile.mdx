# Profile configuration

These configurations are used to control the content of the profile screen as well as how to render the profile UI. Typically for every register in application there is a corresponding profile. Technically the same implementation is used for all profiles, however the content configured.

:::info
For every register in the application there should at least be one profile configuration. Similar registers can re-use the same profile configuration.

### Working with dynamic data queries
Assume you would like to filter resource data based on a criteria that needs computation before application. e.g show patients who are under 5 years or over 18 below, then this is the config to use.

Before you use this rule on a dataQuery, you need  to execute it first. The rules are executed within a `configRules` block which follows rules engine standard and default priority of 1 which can be change based on requirement.

Below is a JSON config that shows how to execute rules. Refer to working with rules section.
``` json
{
  "appId": "appId",
  "configType": "register",
  "id": "childRegister",
  "configRules": [
    {
      "name": "under5",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('under5', dateService.addOrSubtractYearFromCurrentDate(5,'-'))"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Below is a sample dataQuery config to filter register data by configRules.

``` json
"fhirResource": {
  "baseResource": {
    "resource": "Patient",
    "dataQueries": [
      {
        "paramName": "birthdate",
        "filterCriteria": [
          {
            "dataType": "DATE",
            "computedRule": "under5",
            "prefix": "GREATERTHAN_OR_EQUALS"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Config properties

|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|--|
`appId` | `String` - unique identifier for the application | Yes | |
`configType` | Type of configuration | Yes |  `profile` |
`id` | `String` | Yes | |
`fhirResource` | `FhirResourceConfig` | Yes | |
`secondaryResources` | List of `FhirResourceConfig`s | No |
`managingEntity` | `ManagingEntityConfig` | No | |
`profileParams` | A list Strings | Yes |  |
`rules` | List of `RuleConfig`s | Yes | `emptyList()` |
`topAppBar` | `TopBarConfig` | No | |
`views` | List of `ViewProperties` | Yes | |
`fabActions` | List of `NavigationMenuConfig`s| Yes | `emptyList()` |
`overFlowMenuItems` | List of `OverflowMenuItemConfig`s | Yes | `emptyList()` |
`filterActiveResources` | List of `ActiveResourceFilterConfig`s | Yes | `listOf(ActiveResourceFilterConfig(resourceType = ResourceType.Patient, active = true), ActiveResourceFilterConfig(resourceType = ResourceType.Group, active = true))` |
`configRules` | List of `RuleConfig`s | No | `null` |
`contentBackgroundColor` | `String` | No | `#FFFFFF` |

## Dynamic data pass between profiles and registers

For you to pass data between profiles you can make use of **action config params** which are executed when **LAUNCH_PROFILE** is invoked.

Data extraction happens during rules execution and is persisted in `computedValuesMap` which is later used to interpolate values annotated with `@value`.

For example, assume the `LAUNCH_PROFILE` `onClick` function of `practitioner_profile_config` takes you to `household_profile` screen and you would like pass send `practitionerId` from `practitioner_profile_config` to `household_profile`, define it as described below.

### Practitioner **LAUNCH_PROFILE**
1. Write rules to extract the data you need.
  ``` json
  "rules":[
    {
      "name": "practitionerId",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('practitionerId', fhirPath.extractValue(Practitioner, 'Practitioner.id.replace(\"Practitioner/\",\"\")').split(\"/\").get(0))"
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

2. Add your params in **LAUNCH_REGISTER** section of `practition_register_config.json`
  ``` json
  "actions": [
    {
      "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
      "workflow": "LAUNCH_PROFILE",
      "id": "practitionerProfile",
      "params": [
        {
          "paramType": "PARAMDATA",
          "key": "practitionerId",
          "value": "@{practitionerId}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

### household_config.json
A dataquery config to filter by `practitionerId`. For more info refer to dataquery section.

``` json
{
  "id": "householdQueryPractitionerId",
  "filterType": "TOKEN",
  "key": "_tag",
  "valueType": "CODING",
  "valueCoding": {
    "system": "https://smartregister.org/",
    "code": "@{practitionerId}"
  }
}
```

## Dynamic data pass between profiles config properties

|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|--|

`condition`  | specification of execution                            | Yes | `false` |
`actions`    | an array of the rule logic with a fhirPathExpression  | Yes | `null` |
`trigger`    | application workflow action                           | Yes | |
`workflow`   | An application event that can trigger a workflow      | Yes | `null` |
`params`     | An array of actionParameters to pass to another profile | No | emptyArray |
`paramType`  | Action ParameterType to use e.g PREPOPULATE OR PARAMDATA | No | `null` |
`key`        | Action ParameterType unique key if defined but not tag is given | Yes | |
`value`      | Action ParameterType corresponding key's value        | Yes | |
