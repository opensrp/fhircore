# Widgets

Configurations used to configure widgets. FHIR Core uses widgets to render views.

Examples are rows, columns, cards, and buttons.

## LIST widget

### Flex alignment widgets

To display items in flexRow below sample JSON config works fine. Replace **COMPOUND_TEXT** with your preferred widget component. Please note, the below json borrows from **LIST** component properties

``` json
{
  "viewType": "LIST",
  "id": "give_your_list_an_id",
  "baseResource": "Resource_to_use",
  "orientation": "HORIZONTAL",
  "emptyList": {
    "message": ""
  },
  "registerCard": {
    "rules": [],
    "views": [
      {
        "viewType": "COMPOUND_TEXT",
        "primaryTextBackgroundColor": "#F9CFD1",
        "primaryText": "@{carePlanTitle}",
        "primaryTextColor": "@{carePlanTextColor}",
        "fontSize": 13,
        "padding": 7,
        "borderRadius": 6
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Display resources inside another list
To display list resources inside a list and execute it's rules , add it an attribute called **resources** inside your list and define it's parameters as shown in the list below
If the config doesn't have a **resources** attribute, the app logic defaults to using relatedResources and executes rules in the rule config section.
``` json
{
  "viewType": "LIST",
  "id": "readyTasksList",
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "availableTask",
      "relatedResourceId": "availableTasks",
      "resourceType": "Task",
      "conditionalFhirPathExpression": "((Task.status = 'ready' or Task.status = 'cancelled' or  Task.status = 'failed') and (Task.code.empty()))"
    }
  ],
  "emptyList": {
    "message": "No visit tasks available for this patient at the moment"
  },
  "registerCard": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "taskStatus",
        "condition": "true",
        "actions": [
          "data.put('taskStatus', fhirPath.extractValue(Task, 'Task.status'))"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "views": [
      {
        "viewType": "BUTTON",
        "smallSized": "true",
        "text": "@{taskDescriptionWithStartDate}",
        "status": "@{taskStatusColorCode}",
        "visible": "true",
        "enabled": "@{patientActive}",
        "actions": [
          {
            "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
            "workflow": "LAUNCH_QUESTIONNAIRE",
            "questionnaire": {
              "id": "@{taskQuestionnaireId}",
              "title": "@{taskDescription}",
              "saveButtonText": "Save",
              "taskId": "@{taskId}",
              "resourceIdentifier": "@{taskFor}"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### How to use button with icon and copy ability
On top of the above properties, you need to add  Image config properties see a `startIcon config` *** IMAGE widget *** . This displays the icon before the button text

 ``` json
       {
                  "viewType": "BUTTON",
                  "smallSized": "true",
                  "text": "Button text",
                  "status": "DUE",
                  "visible": "visibility condition",
                  "enabled": "enable condition",
                  "startIcon": {
                    "type": "local",
                    "reference": "icon_name if local",
                    "color": "icon color"
                  },
                  "actions": [
                    {
                      "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
                      "workflow": "COPY_TEXT",
                      "params": [
                        {
                          "paramType": "PARAMDATA",
                          "key": "your copy key e.g myKey",
                          "value": "The value to be copied"
                        }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
```
 The data in the params section is transformed into resourceData and the value read in key-value and copied to the clipboard/keyboard

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Config properties of SERVICE_CARD
|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|:--:|
viewType | First viewType should be a list. This will help in iterating over the data to display | Yes | [ViewType.SERVICE_CARD]|
weight | A 'Float' value that represents the type of view. The weight is used to determine how much space the view should occupy in its parent container. |  | The default is 0 |
backgroundColor | The background color of the view, specified as a string in the format "#RRGGBB" or "#AARRGGBB". If this property is null, the view will use its parent's background color. | No |  the default value is #FFFFFF |
padding | Offsets the content of the view by a specific number of pixels. This should be a number | No | 0 |
borderRadius | Rounds the corners of the view's outer edge | | 2 |
alignment | The alignment of the view within's its parent layout. This value is used to distribute the available space among multiple views | | [ViewAlignment.None]|
fillMaxWidth | Determines whether the view should fill its parent's width | | false |
fillMaxHeight | Determines whether the view should fill its parent's height | | false |
clickable | Determines whether the view is clickable | | true |
visible | A String value that determines whether the view should be visible | Yes| true |
details| A list of CompoundTextProperties that represent the details of the service card| yes | emptyList() |

serviceButton | A ButtonProperties object that represents a button displayed in the service card | Yes | null |
services | A list of ButtonProperties that represent the services associated with the service card | yes | null |
actions | A list of ActionConfig objects that represent the actions that can be performed on the service card | yes | emptyList() |


**serviceMemberIcons**<br/><br/>
One of the config properties of the SERVICE_CARD viewType are the serviceMemberIcons. Some icons provided within fhircore
for use include the ![BABY_BOY](/img/ic_baby_boy.svg), ![BABY_GIRL](/img/ic_baby_girl.svg), ![WOMAN_OF_REPRODUCTIVE_AGE](/img/ic_woman_of_reproductive_age.svg),
![POST_PARTUM_MOTHER](/img/ic_post_partum_mother.svg), ![ELDERLY](/img/ic_elderly.svg), and ![SICK_CHILD](/img/ic_sick_child.svg).

Since you could have many icons intended for use, it could be better to extract the icons and add a reference to them
within the service card. Below is an example of a list of extraction rules for BABY_BOY and BABY_GIRL.
``` json
{
  "name": "serviceMemberIcons",
  "condition": "true",
  "actions": [
    "data.put('serviceMemberIcons', StringUtils:join([fhirPath.extractValue(Patient, \"Patient.active and (Patient.birthDate >= today() - 5 'years') and (Patient.gender= 'male')\") == 'true'? 'BABY_BOY': '', fhirPath.extractValue(Patient, \"Patient.active and (Patient.birthDate >= today() - 5 'years') and (Patient.gender= 'female')\") == 'true'? 'BABY_GIRL': ''], ','))"
  ]
}
```

After storing the extracted icons into the data map, we can then reference them while configuring the SERVICE_CARD as exemplified
below.

``` json
{
  "viewType": "SERVICE_CARD",
  "details": [
    ...
  ],
  "serviceMemberIcons": "@{serviceMemberIcons}"
}
```

### Divider Widget

The Divider widget allows one to visually separate and organize different components within a graphical user interface (GUI).
It creates a horizontal line that acts as a visual boundary, enhancing the overall aesthetics and user experience.

To use the Divider widget in the app, one has to define the JSON file as follows:
``` json
{
  "viewType": "BORDER",
  "thickness": 0.8
}
```
The JSON configuration instructs the app to create a Divider widget with the following properties:

- View Type: The `viewType: BORDER` setting specifies the  type of widget that will be rendered, and in this case, it is set to `"BORDER"` type which renders a solid horizontal line as the divider.
- Thickness: The `thickness: 0.8` setting determines the width of the Divider. By adjusting the thickness value, one can precisely control the Divider's visual appearance.

### Config properties of DIVIDER

|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|:--:|
viewType | The type of widget that will be rendered in this case it is the `BORDER` view. | Yes | [ViewType.BORDER]|
thickness | The width of the Divider. | No | 0.5 |
backgroundColor | The background color of the view, specified as a string in the format "#RRGGBB" or "#AARRGGBB". If this property is null, the view will use its parent's background color. | No | #FFFFFF |
visible | A string value that determines whether the view should be visible | No| true |
padding | Offsets the content of the view by a specific number of pixels. This should be a number | No | 0 |

## Spacer Widget

The Spacer widget is used to create a flexible, empty space between two views. It is used to create a space between two views in a layout, and it is also used to create a space between the edge of a view and its parent layout.

To use the Divider widget in the app, one has to define the JSON file as follows:

```json
{
  "viewType": "SPACER",
  "height": 10
}
```
After defining the above JSON example a view will be rendered with the following properties:
- View Type: The `viewType: SPACER` setting specifies that the widget that will be rendered is a spacer, which creates an empty space or gap between other UI elements.
- Height: The `height: 10` setting determines the height of the spacer. By setting the height value to 10, the spacer will have a height of 10 density-independent pixels which scales appropriately across different screen densities, ensuring consistent visual appearance on various devices.

### Config properties of SPACER

|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|:--:|
viewType | The type of widget that will be rendered in this case it is the `SPACER` view. | Yes | [ViewType.SPACER]|
height | The height of the Spacer. | Yes | _ |
backgroundColor | The background color of the view, specified as a string in the format "#RRGGBB" or "#AARRGGBB". If this property is null, the view will use its parent's background color. | No | #FFFFFF |
padding | Offsets the content of the view by a specific number of pixels. This should be a number | No | 0 |

## Personal Data Widgets
