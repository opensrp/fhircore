# Editing

You can manage edits through 

1. complex structure maps to ensure that any potential downstream affects of an edit (like changing CarePlan or Task status) are accounted for,r
2. limiting what is editable to only those pieces that do not have downstream affects.

We suggest following approach (2.) to reduce the chance of errors and the resulting inconsistent data.
