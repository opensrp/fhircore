# Unit Tests

## Naming Conventions

We follow the following naming convention for our test cases:
```
<methodName><ConditionUnderTest><ExpectedBehavior>
```

**Example:** for a sample method:
```kotlin
fun isNumberEven(value:Int):Bool{
```

Sample test case:

```
isNumberEvenWithParameterFiveShouldReturnFalse
```

## Spotless
We use Spotless to maintain the Java/Kotlin coding style in the codebase. Run the following command to check the codebase:

```
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

and run the following command to apply fixes to the violations:

```
./gradlew spotlessApply
```
