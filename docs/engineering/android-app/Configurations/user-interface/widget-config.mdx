# Widget configurations

Configurations used to configure widgets. FHIR Core uses widgets to render views. Examples are rows, columns, cards, and buttons.

## LIST widget

### Flex alignment widgets

To display items in flexRow below sample JSON config works fine. Replace **COMPOUND_TEXT** with your preferred widget component. Please note, the below json borrows from **LIST** component properties

``` json
{
     "viewType": "LIST",
      "id": "give_your_list_an_id",
      "baseResource": "Resource_to_use",
      "orientation": "HORIZONTAL",
       "emptyList": {
        "message": ""
                     },
        "registerCard": {
        "rules": [],
         "views": [
          {
           "viewType": "COMPOUND_TEXT",
            "primaryTextBackgroundColor": "#F9CFD1",
             "primaryText": "@{carePlanTitle}",
             "primaryTextColor": "@{carePlanTextColor}",
             "fontSize": 13,
             "padding": 7,
              "borderRadius": 6
      }
    ]
    }
   }
```

### Display resources inside another list
To display list resources inside a list and execute it's rules , add it an attribute called **resources** inside your list and define it's parameters as shown in the list below
If the config doesn't have a **resources** attribute, the app logic defaults to using relatedResources and executes rules in the rule config section.
``` json
{
  "viewType": "LIST",
  "id": "readyTasksList",
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "availableTask",
      "relatedResourceId": "availableTasks",
      "resourceType": "Task",
      "conditionalFhirPathExpression": "((Task.status = 'ready' or Task.status = 'cancelled' or  Task.status = 'failed') and (Task.code.empty()))"
    }
  ],
  "emptyList": {
    "message": "No visit tasks available for this patient at the moment"
  },
  "registerCard": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "taskStatus",
        "condition": "true",
        "actions": [
          "data.put('taskStatus', fhirPath.extractValue(Task, 'Task.status'))"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "views": [
      {
        "viewType": "BUTTON",
        "smallSized": "true",
        "text": "@{taskDescriptionWithStartDate}",
        "status": "@{taskStatusColorCode}",
        "visible": "true",
        "enabled": "@{patientActive}",
        "actions": [
          {
            "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
            "workflow": "LAUNCH_QUESTIONNAIRE",
            "questionnaire": {
              "id": "@{taskQuestionnaireId}",
              "title": "@{taskDescription}",
              "saveButtonText": "Save",
              "taskId": "@{taskId}",
              "resourceIdentifier": "@{taskFor}"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

            }
        ]
```

### Config properties of VIEW

### Divider Widget

The Divider widget allows one to visually separate and organize different components within a graphical user interface (GUI).
It creates a horizontal line that acts as a visual boundary, enhancing the overall aesthetics and user experience.

To use the Divider widget in the app, one has to define the JSON file as follows:
```json
{
  "viewType": "BORDER",
  "thickness": 0.8
}
```
The JSON configuration instructs the app to create a Divider widget with the following properties:

- View Type: The `viewType: BORDER` setting specifies the  type of widget that will be rendered, and in this case, it is set to `"BORDER"` type which renders a solid horizontal line as the divider.
- Thickness: The `thickness: 0.8` setting determines the width of the Divider. By adjusting the thickness value, one can precisely control the Divider's visual appearance.

## Spacer Widget

The Spacer widget is used to create a flexible, empty space between two views. It is used to create a space between two views in a layout, and it is also used to create a space between the edge of a view and its parent layout.

To use the Divider widget in the app, one has to define the JSON file as follows:

```json
{
  "viewType": "SPACER",
  "height": 10
}
```
After defining the above JSON example a view will be rendered with the following properties:
- View Type: The `viewType: SPACER` setting specifies that the widget that will be rendered is a spacer, which creates an empty space or gap between other UI elements.
- Height: The `height: 10` setting determines the height of the spacer. By setting the height value to 10, the spacer will have a height of 10 density-independent pixels which scales appropriately across different screen densities, ensuring consistent visual appearance on various devices.
