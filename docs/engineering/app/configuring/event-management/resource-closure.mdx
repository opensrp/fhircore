# Resource closure using configured questionnaires

Event management implementation provides the ability to configure a questionnaire so that we can state which resources to close when it is submitted.

Some use cases would be -
* Closing CarePlans and Tasks for a patient/family when they are removed.
* Closing child-related CarePlans and Tasks if a patient's age is updated to more than 5 years.
* Closing ANC CarePlan and Tasks when a pregnancy outcome form is submitted.

This is achieved by use of the `EventWorkFlow` config.

The current implementation eventWorkflow config only handle closure of resources, hence the event type defaults to `RESOURCE_CLOSURE`. This implementation can be expanded in future to handle other types of events.

The trigger conditions determine whether to close resources depending on the the result of evaluating the fhirpath expressions.
The fhirpath expressions can be run against
1. The subject of the questionnaire e.g `Patient.active`
2. The Bundle resource which contains the `QuestionnaireResponse`, the `subject` as well as additional resources. An example expression would be `%resource.entry.where(resource is QuestionnaireResponse).resource.where(questionnaire = 'Questionnaire/450cb100-0c5b-47c6-9f33-2830a79be726').exists()`
3. A combination of both the `subject` and `Bundle` e.g `Patient.active AND %resource.entry.where(resource is QuestionnaireResponse).resource.where(questionnaire = 'Questionnaire/450cb100-0c5b-47c6-9f33-2830a79be726').exists()`

The event resources define which resource is eligible for closure as well as any related resources.

The data queries define how to search for and filter the resources from the database.

Once the resources have been retrieved from the database, the next step is to close the resources by updating the values of certain fields. For the current implementation this has been done in the code. This is not configurable at this point.
Closure of any resource that has not been handled will need an update to the code that performs resource closure.

The following table contains the values for each field that is required to close a resource.field

| Resource | Field | Value |
| :---         |     :---      |           :--- |
| Careplan  | status     | Completed   |
| Task     | status      | cancelled      |
|      | lastModified      | current date      |
| Condition     |   Condition.clinicalStatus    |  code:370996005, display:resolved, system: http://www.snomed.org/   |
| Procedure     |  Procedure.status     |  stopped     |
| ServiceRequest     |  status     |   revoked |
