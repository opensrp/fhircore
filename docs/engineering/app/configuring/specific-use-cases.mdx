# Specific use cases

This section of the docs describes specific health care use cases and examples of how to configure FHIR content to be relevant to them.

## Antenatal care (ANC)

### Multiple births

You can manage recording multiple births by using

1. complex Questionnaires with repeated group functionality to create block sections that can be repeated for the n-times where n is the number of newborns to be registered,
2. tasking approach that allows you to create mini-tasks for launching a newborn registration Questionnaire, each task will represent a new newborn due for registration hence dynamically generating tasks based on the total number of newborns.

Either of the two options above can be configured to achieve multiple birth registration as explored below.

#### Using repeated groups

To create a repeated group Questionnaire, you will need to create a Questionnaire item of type `group` with the `repeat` attribute set to true. This approach assumes the following;

- all the Questionnaire sections are answered at once, hence combining both pregnancy outcome questions together with newborn registration questions,
- all data required to answer the complex Questionnaire is available from the start.

1.  Create a new item of type group in the Questionnaire to hold the newborn registration questions then set the repeats to `true`

"type": "group",
"extension": [
    {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs",
        "valueInteger": 1
    },
    {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs",
        "valueInteger": 9
    },
    {
        "url": "http://ehelse.no/fhir/StructureDefinition/repeatstext",
        "valueString": "Add Child"
    }
],
"required": false,
"repeats": true,
"text": "Add Child Details",
```

2. You can opt to use a single page Questionnaire that scrolls to targeted block sections or alternatively you can use a paginated Questionnaire

#### Using a tasking approach

Handling multiple births using the tasking approach requires one to generate child registration tasks using a linked PlanDefinition by defining an evaluation criteria on the ActivityDefinition of the linked PlanDefinition.
Using a StructureMap to generate tasks by linking it in the action to create Tasks dynamically based on number children born. Below is a sample PlanDefinition ActivityDefinition action:

```
{
    "prefix": "new-born-registration",
    "priority": "routine",
    "condition": [
        {
            "kind": "applicability",
            "expression": {
                "language": "text/fhirpath",
                "expression": "fhirpath to evaluate criteria"
            }
        }
    ],
    "definitionCanonical": "#careplan-new-born-registration",
    "transform": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureMap/uuid"
}
```

To generate the tasks dynamically, evaluate the number of children born response from the context QuestionnaireResponse and use it to iterate to generate tasks matching the number of children.
