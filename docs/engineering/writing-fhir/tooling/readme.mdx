# Tooling

[fhir-tooling](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling) simplifies FHIR data management by converting, validating, extracting, uploading, and cleaning resources.

- [**cleaner**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/tree/main/cleaner) - it efficiently removes specific FHIR resources from a FHIR API based on user-defined filtering criteria, streamlining data maintenance.
- [**efsity**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/tree/main/efsity) - efsity streamlines authoring and managing FHIRCore app configurations and content through command-line conversions, validations, translations, and publishing.
- [**importer**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/tree/main/importer) - The importer script streamlines the management of FHIR resources and Keycloak roles through CSV-based bulk operations, covering creation, assignment, updates, and even deletion of duplicates.
- [**uploader**](https://github.com/onaio/fhir-tooling/tree/main/uploader) - The uploader script automates content uploads to a FHIR server, simplifying the process through command-line execution and configuration.
