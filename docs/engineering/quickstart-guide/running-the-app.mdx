title: Running the App
---

These guides assume you have an existing FHIR Store set up with a typical FHIR Information Gateway connected to a backend Identity and Access Management (IAM) system and transactional FHIR data store with a standard FHIR API.

We will go through the example of setting up an electronic immunization registry (EIR) for a community health worker (CHW) expected to use the app. As we go we will note reusable pieces of functionality and at the end we will reference a number of use cases that can be addressed with a similar pattern.

## Deploying the infrastructure

Building a FHIR Core app using OpenSRP FHIRCore requires familiarity with both the OpenSRP platform and the HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.
The FHIRCore project, built on OpenSRP, is designed to facilitate the development of healthcare applications that interact with FHIR-compliant data stores. Here’s a step-by-step guide
to help you build a FHIR Core app using this repository:

### Prerequisites

1.	Technical Knowledge:

	-	Basic understanding of the FHIR standard.
	-	Familiarity with Android development (Java/Kotlin).
	-	Familiarity with Gradle, Docker, and possibly Kubernetes (if you are running OpenSRP in a containerized environment).

2.	Required Tools:

	-	Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or above).
	-	Android Studio.
	-	Git (for cloning the repository).
	-	Docker (optional for local server setup).

3.	Backend servers:

	-	See [Running the backend](/docs/engineering/quickstart-guide/server-setup.mdx).

### Creating a custom app release

Creating a custom app release is necessary if you want to change the server that your OpenSRP2 app connects with. However, if you have or were already provided an app pointing to the server that you plan to use you can skip this step.

1. Clone the FHIRCore Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

````
git clone https://github.com/opensrp/fhircore.git
cd fhircore
````
2. Set Up Development Environment

	-	Install the latest version of Android Studio and configure the SDK.

	-	Open the cloned fhircore project in Android Studio.

Ensure that you have the appropriate Android SDKs installed. The project usually targets SDK 30 (Android 11) or above, so make sure you have this version or later installed in your environment.

3. Build the Project

Before you can start working on the app, you will need to sync the project with Gradle to install dependencies and build the project.

	-	Open Android Studio.

	-	Navigate to the project folder and open the build.gradle file.

	-	Click the Sync Project with Gradle Files button in Android Studio to install dependencies.

	-	Update local.properties file by providing the required Keycloak credentials to enable syncing of data to and from the HAPI FHIR server:

		````
		#oauth configurations
		OAUTH_BASE_URL=https://keycloak-stage.smartregister.org/auth/realms/FHIR_Android/
		OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="provide client id"
		OAUTH_SCOPE=openid

		#fhir store base url
		FHIR_BASE_URL=https://fhir.labs.smartregister.org/fhir/

		#sentry dsn
		SENTRY_DSN=<https://your/sentry/project/dsn>

		#Optional: Application id for a specific build variant
		#OPENSRP_APP_ID="app/debug"

		````

Once synced, click on Build > Make Project to compile the code.

For more information read more [here](https://docs.opensrp.io/engineering/app/developer-setup)


### Deploying the reference content

To load into the OpenSRP FHIR Core app on demand, for debug and development, you can create a symbolic link using:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ona-health/giz-eir-fhir-resources.git
# assuming you have checked out fhircore in the same directory
mkdir -p fhircore/android/quest/src/gizeir/assets/configs
ln -s `pwd`/giz-eir-fhir-resources/app/* fhircore/android/quest/src/gizEir/assets/configs/gizeir
```

The app is able to use content for configuration resources from the `configs/app/resources` directory in the assets directory. Ideally, any FHIR resource can be loaded into
 the application through the assets.The current implementation loads the configuration resources declared in the Composition (including Questionnaires, StructureMaps, PlanDefs, Lists, etc) by retrieving them
from the server, which requires the device to be online. This enhancement should allow the user to create config directories for the resources inside `/configs/app/resources`.
 The resources directory name should be in lowercase format e.g. `configs/app/resources/binary`, `configs/app/resources/questionnaire`, `configs/app/resources/structuremap`,
 `configs/app/resources/plandefinition`, etc.

## Scheduling & tasking

In an offline-first community health application, scheduling and tasking refer to systems and processes used to manage appointments, follow-ups, and task assignments for healthcare workers and community health programs. These features are designed to work seamlessly in environments with intermittent or no internet access, ensuring that healthcare activities continue without disruption. Here’s a breakdown of each concept:

1. Scheduling in an Offline-First Community Health Application

Scheduling involves planning and organizing patient visits, consultations, or any healthcare-related appointments. In an offline-first application, it requires the following components:

Features:

- **Appointment Booking**: Health workers can schedule appointments with patients for home visits, checkups, immunizations, or follow-up care. These appointments are saved locally and synchronized with the central server once connectivity is restored.
- **Calendar and Reminders**: The app provides a calendar view of upcoming appointments and sends reminders (either through notifications or on-screen prompts) to healthcare workers about scheduled visits.
- **Recurrence & Follow-Up Visits**: Many community health activities require regular follow-ups (e.g., maternal health visits, chronic disease management). The app allows scheduling of recurring appointments with automatic reminders.
- **Task and Visit Status Tracking**: Scheduled tasks (such as immunizations or wellness checks) are tracked by status: completed, overdue, upcoming, or in-progress. Health workers can update task status offline, and this data syncs when the app reconnects.

Offline-first Considerations:

- **Local Data Storage**: Scheduling and appointment data are stored locally on the health worker’s device so they can access patient schedules and update visit details even without internet.
- **Automatic Sync**: When internet connectivity is restored, the app automatically syncs appointments and scheduling data with a central database.

2. Tasking in an Offline-First Community Health Application

Tasking refers to assigning and tracking healthcare-related tasks that health workers must perform in the community, such as patient checkups, vaccination campaigns, or health education.

Features:

- **Task Assignment**: Health workers are assigned tasks by supervisors or the health management system. These tasks can include patient visits, data collection, or specific treatments. Tasks are stored locally and synced with the central system later.
- **Task Types**: Tasks can be varied, including:
  - **Clinical tasks**: Conducting patient assessments, administering medication, vaccinations.
  - **Non-clinical tasks**: Collecting health data, providing health education, monitoring chronic illnesses.
- **Task Prioritization and Status**: Tasks can be prioritized as high, medium, or low, and can be marked as completed, in-progress, or overdue by the health worker. This allows for better time management and resource allocation in low-connectivity areas.
- **Dynamic Task Updates**: In some cases, tasks may change based on patient outcomes or additional needs identified during visits. Health workers can update task details offline, and the system will push these updates once connectivity is restored.
- **Team Collaboration**: In larger teams, task assignments can be distributed among multiple health workers. Task progress is tracked so that health supervisors can monitor the completion of assignments once sync is completed.

Offline-first Considerations:

- **Task Creation & Assignment Offline**: Health workers can receive new tasks even while offline, either through pre-downloaded updates or user-defined task generation (e.g., scheduling a follow-up visit).
- **Local Task Management**: Tasks are stored on the health worker’s device, and they can update task progress (such as marking it complete) without needing real-time connectivity.
- **Synchronization**: When connectivity is re-established, the app syncs task completion, updates, and any newly assigned tasks with the main server. This ensures that tasks completed in offline mode are recognized centrally.

Supporting Tasking using a PlanDefinition resource in FHIR

In FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), PlanDefinition is a core resource used to describe workflows, protocols, or plans for healthcare activities, including scheduling and task management. A PlanDefinition supports the definition of various tasks and schedules that healthcare workers follow in community health applications. Here’s how PlanDefinition supports offline-first scheduling and tasking in such applications:

1. Defining Workflows and Care Plans with PlanDefinition

	•	PlanDefinition in FHIR is used to define a blueprint for care delivery workflows and task management.

	•	It can outline tasks, actions, and schedules that healthcare workers need to follow. This can be particularly useful in creating reusable care plans, such as maternal care, child immunization campaigns, or chronic disease monitoring.

2. Using PlanDefinition for Scheduling

	•	PlanDefinition can define schedules for specific healthcare activities. The action element within a PlanDefinition specifies a sequence of activities, including scheduling appointments and follow-ups.

	•	Each action can include timing rules (using timing[x]), recurrence patterns (for follow-up visits), and conditions for triggering the task.

	•	In offline-first systems, these schedules are defined and stored on the local device, allowing healthcare workers to access them even without connectivity.

3. Tasking with PlanDefinition

	•	PlanDefinition supports task management by detailing specific tasks that healthcare workers must perform during a workflow.

	•	A PlanDefinition can include multiple action elements, where each action represents a task (e.g., administer a vaccine, collect data, monitor vitals).

	•	Tasks can also have dependencies, where certain tasks are triggered based on the completion or outcome of previous tasks.

	•	The tasks can be configured to change dynamically based on patient outcomes or new needs that arise during care delivery.

4. Handling Offline Synchronization

	•	When the healthcare worker is offline, all scheduling and task-related data (defined by the PlanDefinition) are stored locally.

	•	Once the healthcare worker regains connectivity, the app synchronizes the task progress, updates, and scheduling changes to the server.

	•	This synchronization ensures that both the local app and central server have consistent data, allowing healthcare supervisors to monitor care delivery even in remote or low-connectivity regions.

5. Using PlanDefinition with Other FHIR Resources

	•	PlanDefinition often works in combination with other FHIR resources to support scheduling and tasking:

	-	Task: Used to track the execution of actions defined in a PlanDefinition.

	-	CarePlan: Represents an individualized plan of care for a patient, using PlanDefinition as a template.

	-	ServiceRequest: Represents a request for a service to be performed (e.g., a lab test, a procedure) as part of a task.

### Child Immunization

The PlanDefinition resource in FHIR defines several immunization-related activities for child immunization. Each ActivityDefinition outlines specific tasks, including the administration of vaccines, detailing the type of vaccine, schedule, and responsible parties.

Example of scheduling with PlanDefinition:

![immunization config](/img/eir_configs/immunization-pd.png)

Reference PlanDefinition can  be found [here](https://github.com/ona-health/giz-eir-fhir-resources/blob/main/plan_definition/child_immunizations.fhir.json)

General Setup (First Activity) - "Child Register Handler Activity":

This activity handles the initial setup of a care plan when a child is registered.
It dynamically sets attributes like title, description, status, and care plan start and end dates based on the child's birthdate.
The activity also assigns a general practitioner as the performer and sets up an ongoing task to manage the care plan.
Specific Immunization Tasks: Each subsequent `ActivityDefinition` outlines a different immunization task:

1. BCG Immunization: Administered shortly after birth, with a booster scheduled later.
2. OPV (Oral Poliovirus Vaccine): Multiple doses scheduled at various weeks (6, 10, and 14 weeks).
3. PENTA Immunization: Similar to OPV with a series of three doses, followed by a booster.
4. ROTA Immunization: Administered in a two-dose series for protection against rotavirus.
5. PCV (Pneumococcal Vaccine): Three doses to protect against pneumococcal infections, with a booster.
6. IPV (Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine): Single dose of inactivated polio vaccine.
7. Measles Immunization: Scheduled at 9 months and then a booster at 18 months.

For each immunization, the `ActivityDefinition` includes:

- Status: `"active"` indicating the task is currently in progress.
- Description: Provides a short description of the immunization.
- Kind: Indicates the task type (in this case, all are "Task").
- Coding: Maps the immunization to a specific procedure code.
- Dosage Information: Specifies the sequence of doses, timing, and intervals for each vaccine.

These definitions help automate the creation and management of a child's immunization schedule within a care plan in FHIR-based healthcare systems.


### Child Recurring Services

Key Components:

Contained Activity Definitions: These are activities defined within the care plan for various recurring services for children.

1. `careplan-init-activity`: Initializes the care plan when the child is registered, pulling dynamic values (such as the child’s ID and birthdate) to populate the CarePlan resource.
2. `careplan-vita-ifc-task-activity`: Specifies the administration of Vitamin A IFC service, scheduled every 6 months.
3. `careplan-vita-task-activity`: Another Vitamin A service scheduled more frequently, with 10 occurrences over a period of 6 months each.
4. `careplan-deworming-task-activity`: Defines the deworming service, administered every 6 months, recurring 9 times.
5. `careplan-itn-task-activity`: Specifies the ITN (Insecticide-treated net) service, provided every 6 months, up to 5 times.

Dynamic Values: In the careplan-init-activity, FHIRPath expressions are used to dynamically set values in the care plan based on the child’s details. For instance:

- The title and description of the care plan are set to the values from the root resource.
- The care plan’s start period is set to the child’s birthdate, and the end period is calculated to be approximately 11 years later (4017 days).
- The author and performer of the activities are based on the first general practitioner assigned to the child.

Scheduled Services:

- Timing and Dosage: Each ActivityDefinition for services like Vitamin A, Deworming, and ITN provides the timing details of when the service is administered. This includes how many times the service is repeated (e.g., every 6 months).
- Status and Kind: All activities are marked as active, with the kind set to Task, indicating that these are recurring, scheduled services.

This structure automates the generation of a child’s recurring care plan, ensuring that essential health services are administered at appropriate intervals.

### Recording vaccinations

Recording vaccinations, and in some usecases routine/recurring child services, is a key components of an immunization app.
