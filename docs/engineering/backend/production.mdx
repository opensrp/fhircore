# Production setup

This page provides recommendations when setting up a production deployment. 
 
### Keycloak Oauth2 clients

We use [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as our IAM server that stores users, groups, and the access roles of those groups. Before starting the set up of the Keycloak Oauth clients ensure the `Service Account` Role is **disabled**.  
_Separate_ OAuth clients should be configured for the ETL Pipes/Analytics and the FHIR Web systems.


#### Android client
Enable **Direct Access Grant only** - This client should be configured as a `Public` client. To fetch a token you will not need the client secret. 
This will use the `Resource Credentials/Password` Grant type. 

:::danger

Do not store any sensitive data like _password credentials_ or _secrets_ in your production APK e.g. in the `local.properties` file.

::::

#### FHIR Web client
Enable **Client Authentication** and enable **Standard flow**. _Implicit flow should only be used for local dev testing - it can be configured for stage and maybe preview but NOT production._. 
This will use the `Authorization Code` Grant type

#### Data pipelines/Analytics client
Enable **Client Authentication** and enable **Service Account Roles**. 
This will use the `Client Credentials` Grant type.
