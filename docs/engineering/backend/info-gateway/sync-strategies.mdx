title: Sync Strategies
---

The OpenSRP 2.0 uses **five** key data elements in determining how data is synced down from the server. These elements are used to [**tag**](/engineering/app/datastore/tagging) every resource created by the OpenSRP mobile application, enabling precise synchronization.
The five elements are leveraged to define the OpenSRP sync strategies, ensuring that data is appropriately filtered and delivered to the correct users.

### Sync By Practitioner CareTeam
This strategy syncs data based on the Practitioner CareTeam, ensuring that all relevant resources tagged with a specific care team are synced down for the practitioners assigned to that CareTeam. A sample tag is provided below

```json
    {
      "system": "https://smartregister.org/care-team-tag-id",
      "code": "47d68cac-306f-4b75-9704-b4ed48b24f76",
      "display": "Practitioner CareTeam"
    }
```

### Sync By Practitioner Team (Organization)
This sync strategy is based on the Team (Organization), syncing resources related to the specific team (organization) associated with the practitioner. 
- This sync strategy also includes data from any CareTeams that have the Organization as a [managing organization](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/careteam-definitions.html#CareTeam.managingOrganization). A sample tag is provided below

```json
    {
      "system": "https://smartregister.org/organisation-tag-id",
      "code": "ca7d3362-8048-4fa0-8fdd-6da33423cc6b",
      "display": "Practitioner Organization"
    }
```
### Sync By Practitioner Location
Syncs data based on the Location, delivering resources tagged with the Location ID of the Location that the practitioner is assigned to. 
- This sync strategy also includes data from all the child locations for the Location the Practitioner is assigned to. A sample tag is provided below

```json
     {
      "system": "https://smartregister.org/location-tag-id",
      "code": "ca7d3362-8048-4fa0-8fdd-6da33423cc6b",
      "display": "Practitioner Location"
    }
```
### Sync By Related Entity Location
This strategy uses location information related to other entities (e.g Patient Location, Family (Group) Location, Service point), ensuring that data linked to specific locations associated with those entities is synced. 
- This sync strategy also includes data from all the child locations linked to the Related Entity Location. A sample tag is provided below

```json
    {
      "system": "https://smartregister.org/related-entity-location-tag-id",
      "code": "33f45e09-f96e-41d3-9916-fb96455a4cb2",
      "display": "Related Entity Location"
    }
```
