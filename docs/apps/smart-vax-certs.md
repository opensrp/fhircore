# OpenSRP FHIR Core Smart Vaccination Certificates

OpenSRP FHIR Core for Smart Vaccination Certificates for Android implements the Smart Certificates protocol for recording, storing, validation, and generating certificates verifying vaccination status. All the Patient data is eventually going to be mapped as an  **International Patient Summary ([IPS](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/ddcc/StructureDefinition-Patient-pre-uv-ips.html)) document** i.e. is an electronic health record extract containing essential healthcare information about a subject of care. As specified in EN 17269 and ISO/DIS 27269, it is designed for supporting the use case scenario for ‘unplanned, cross border care’, but it is not limited to it. It is intended to be international, i.e., to provide generic solutions for global application beyond a particular region or country.

## Currently supported Smart Vaccination Certificates

**- Covid-19**
In a mission to help digitize the managemnet  of the Immunization process against Covid-19, the OpenSRP FHIR Core application has implmeted an application that helpd to enroll perople to the platform and track their vaccination status with the ability to preoduce Digital Smart Vaccine Certitifcates embeed in QR codes. This is inline with the WHO Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates: Vaccination Status (DDCC:VS) protocol.  

For continuity of Care we have the following usecases 
1. Paper first - A guideline-based vaccine administration is recorded on paper. After the vaccination event, data about it can be entered into a Digital Health Solution.
2. Offline digital - A guideline-based vaccine administration is recorded using an offline secure Digital Health Solution, with the content uploaded, subsequently, to an online Digital Health Solution.
3. Online digital - A guideline-based vaccine administration is recorded using an online secure Digital Health Solution which updates the content in real time.

While for Proof of Vacination
1. A Verifier verifies a DDCC:VS using digital cryptographic processes in an offline/online mode.



At the momnet the applciation supports the following flow :
1. Patient present him/herself to a clinic or a facility in which theyu seek to be Immunized against the Covid-19 virus 
2.  The Patient will present any fomr of identification  at the vaccination clinic and is authenticated by the Caregiver (or other health personnel) using some form of identification (authentication process depends on the country norm. It may be an ID card or might just be Name & DOB).Register the Patient (done by a caregiver) by capturing the Name and DOB only. No PII is going to be collected inline with GDPR Compliant Privacy Policy.  
3. The Caregiver will first query the system via a Search by name (first name or last name) to ensure that the patient details are not pre existing . The Vaccinator pulls out new paper card with a health certificate id whihc could be inform of a barcode 
4. They will then proceed to Scan barcode with the Health Certificate Identifier ID (HCID) and associate to the patients details .
5. Once the details are captured and verified , the caregiver will thus proceed to give the patient the  vaccine dose, and record the vaccination details in app as per minimum data set5
6.  Record vaccination elements will include the following  Vaccine or prophylaxis,Vaccine brand,Vaccine manufacturer,Vaccine market authorization holder,Vaccine batch number,Date of vaccination,Dose number,Total doses,Country of vaccination,Administering centre,Health worker identifier],Disease or agent targeted,Due date of next dose 
7. Once all trhe fields are validated , the vaccination bundle is submitted to the health portal that will be used to collect and track the Immnizatio details 
8.  The Caregiver (Nurse or administrator) at the facility can then  uses the web portal to view certificates generated by certificate generation  service which also  returns QR code, that can be printed on a paper card of sent digital as a digital receipt to a receipient
