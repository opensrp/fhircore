# Register configuration

Registers are the entry point to FHIRCore application. Typically this is a list used to displayed the configured [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/resourcelist.html). Clicking on a register item directs the user to the configured profile.

:::info
For every register in the application there should at least be one profile configuration. Similar registers can re-use the same profile configuration.

### Working with dynamic data queries
Assume you would like to filter resource data based on a criteria that needs computation before application. e.g show patients who are under 5 years or over 18 below, then this is the config to use.
Before you use this rule on a dataQuery, you need  to execute it first. The rules are executed within a `configRules` block which follows rules engine standard and default priority of 1 which can be change based on requirement.
Below is a JSON config that shows how to execute rules.Refer to working with rules section.
``` json
{
 "appId": "appId",
  "configType": "register",
  "id": "childRegister",
  "configRules": [
    {
      "name": "under5",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('under5', dateService.addOrSubtractTimeUnitFromCurrentDate(5,'-','YEAR'))"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Below is a sample dataQuery config to filter register data by configRules

``` json
"fhirResource": {
    "baseResource": {
      "resource": "Patient",
      "dataQueries": [
        {
          "paramName": "birthdate",
          "filterCriteria": [
            {
              "dataType": "DATE",
              "computedRule": "under5",
              "prefix": "GREATERTHAN_OR_EQUALS"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    }
```

## Config properties

|Property | Description | Required | Default |
|--|--|:--:|:--:|
appId | Unique identifier for the application | Yes | |
configType | Type of configuration | Yes |  `register` |
computedRules | A block that defines the rules to execute | no |  null |
baseResource | base resource to load data from | Yes | |
paramName | dataQuery unique identifier | Yes |   |
filterCriteria | a list of logic to be executed | Yes | |
filterCriteria: dataType | dataType of the filter param | Yes |   |
filterCriteria: computedRule | key that will hold dynamic value after computation | No but recommended |  app defaults to using value/valueDate/valueDateTime |
filterCriteria: prefix | criteria to use  | No | null  |


## Dynamic data pass between Registers and Profiles
For you to pass data between registers you can make use of **action config params** which are executed when **LAUNCH_REGISTER** is invoked.registers
Data extraction happens during rules execution and is persisted in computedValuesMap which is later using to interpolated values annotated with @value.registers
For example, assume the LAUNCH_REGISTER onClick function of practition_register_config takes you to household_profile screen and you would like pass send practitionerId from practition_register_config to household_profile, define it as described below

### Practitioner LAUNCH_REGISTER
#### Sample JSON
1. Write rules to extract the data you need.
``` json
"rules":[
     {
      "name": "practitionerId",
      "condition": "true",
      "actions": [
        "data.put('practitionerId', fhirPath.extractValue(Practitioner, 'Practitioner.id.replace(\"Practitioner/\",\"\")').split(\"/\").get(0))"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

2. add your params at **LAUNCH_REGISTER** section of practition_register_config.json
#### Sample JSON
``` json
     {
                          "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
                          "workflow": "LAUNCH_REGISTER",
                          "id": "householdRegister",
                          "display": "@{practitionerName} - Household Register",
                          "params": [
                            {
                              "paramType": "PARAMDATA",
                              "key": "practitionerId",
                              "value": "@{practitionerId}"
                            }
                          ]
                        }
```

### Household_config.json
A dataquery config to filter by practitionerId. For more info refer to dataquery section

#### Sample JSON

``` json
      {
          "id": "householdQueryPractitionerId",
          "filterType": "TOKEN",
          "key": "_tag",
          "valueType": "CODING",
          "valueCoding": {
            "system": "https://smartregister.org/",
            "code": "@{practitionerId}"
          }
        }
```

### Practitioner LAUNCH_PROFILE (Register and Profile use same type of Resource)
#### Sample JSON
Add your params at **SERVICE_CARD actions** section of practitioner_register_config.json  
Set the value of the `trigger` to `ON_CLICK`.  
Set the value of `workflow` to `LAUNCH_PROFILE`  
Set the value of `id` to the id of the profile configuration to be launched e.g `practitionerProfile`  
The default implementation opens the profile using the `id` of the base resource used to load the register row
#### Sample JSON
``` json
             {
               "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
               "workflow": "LAUNCH_PROFILE",
               "id": "practitionerProfile"
             }
```

### Task Register launch Patient Profile (Register and Profile use different Resource types)
#### Sample JSON
1. Write rules to extract the data you need.
``` json
"rules":[
            {
                "name": "patientId",
                "condition": "true",
                "actions": [
                    "data.put('patientId', fhirPath.extractValue(Patient.get(0), \"Patient.id\"))"
                ]
             }
  ]
```

2. Add your params at **SERVICE_CARD actions** section of task_register_config.json
   Set the value of the `trigger` to `ON_CLICK`.  
   Set the value of `workflow` to `LAUNCH_PROFILE`  
   Set the value of `id` to the id of the profile configuration to be launched e.g `practitionerProfile`  
   Add an action parameter with the following values  
      - `paramType` set to `RESOURCE_ID`. This allows the user to specify the id of the resource used to open the profile  
      - `key` user defined value for the key e.g `patientId`  
      - `value` Set the value of the resource id to be used to open the profile  
#### Sample JSON
``` json
        {
            "trigger": "ON_CLICK",
            "workflow": "LAUNCH_PROFILE",
            "id": "patientProfile",
            "params": [
                {
                    "paramType": "RESOURCE_ID",
                    "key": "patientId",
                    "value": "@{patientId}"
                }
            ]
        }
```
