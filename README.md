<img align=center width=400 src="docs/assets/fhircore.png">

FHIRcore is an OpenSRP implementation of the [HL7 Fhir](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) standard for Health Care data based on [Google FHIR SDK](https://github.com/google/android-fhir).


## Getting Started
this folder is organized as such:
* **android**: The root folder for building the Android applications. [Read more for Android Studio setup instructions](android/README.md)
* **docs**: A library of documents describing the FHIR Core Solution. [read more](docs/README.md)

We recommend going through some of the [docs](docs) before setting up the Android Studio Project in the [android](android) folder.
