## Getting Started
The repo is currently organized to in this structure:

* **android** : The root folder for building the Android applications. For setup instructions [follow this instructions](android/README.md)

We recommend going through some of the documentation to have some understanding of the FHIR core project before setting up your Andorid Studio and running the Andorid Project in  the `andorid` folder.
